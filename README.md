# DeFake_front

DeFake is a project for SKKU Capstone Design Project class.

We are trying to make a web application that detects deepfakes in videos.

Plan: user inputs YouTube URL -> web connects to HuggingFace -> gets result from video & audio detection algorithm -> shows result -> download report via .docx


## To run the app

run at terminal 

`
npm run dev
`
